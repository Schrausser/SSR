# SSR
Solar System Simulation `SSR`. Android globus coelestis (celestial globe) and interactive calendar with zodiac signs and timepiece covering the solar system in the entire observable universe up to $r=14.25Gpc.$ Contains $n=69$ stars, $n=70$ nebulae and star clusters, most important Milky Way objects, $n=48$ galaxies and galaxy clusters as well as the most well-known quasars. Full implementation of all $n=110$ Messier objects (Messier, 1784) and more.
