abstract = {We measured the angular rotation and proper motion of the Triangulum Galaxy (M33) with the Very Long Baseline Array by observing two H2O masers on opposite sides of the galaxy. By comparing the angular rotation rate with the inclination and rotation speed, we obtained a distance of 730 ± 168 kiloparsecs. This distance is consistent with the most recent Cepheid distance measurement. M33 is moving with a velocity of 190 ± 59 kilometers per second relative to the Milky Way. These measurements promise a method to determine dynamical models for the Local Group and the mass and dark-matter halos of M31, M33, and the Milky Way.}

abstract = {A brief narrative on how the effective radius and isophotal diameters were accepted as galaxy size measures is presented. Evidence suggests that these parameters were defined only based on observational premises, independent of any astrophysical theories. An alternative, new physically motivated size definition based on the expected gas density threshold required for star formation in galaxies is proposed. The intrinsic scatter of the size–stellar mass relation using the new size measure is 0.06 dex, three times smaller than that of the relation with the effective radius as size. The new physically motivated size measure can be adopted in upcoming deep, wide imaging surveys.}

abstract = {Ultraluminous x-ray sources (ULXs) are strange objects in other galaxies that cannot be explained by conventional accretion onto stellar-mass objects. This has led to exotic interpretations, such as the long-sought intermediate-mass black holes. Israel et al. observed a ULX in the nearby galaxy NGC 5907 and found that it is instead a neutron star. The spinning neutron star is accreting material so fast that its spin period is quickly accelerating. The only way that it can consume enough material to explain these properties is if it has a strong multipolar magnetic field. Science, this issue p. 817 An ultraluminous x-ray source in NGC 5907 is a spinning neutron star with a complex magnetic field. Ultraluminous x-ray sources (ULXs) in nearby galaxies shine brighter than any x-ray source in our Galaxy. ULXs are usually modeled as stellar-mass black holes (BHs) accreting at very high rates or intermediate-mass BHs. We present observations showing that NGC 5907 ULX is instead an x-ray accreting neutron star (NS) with a spin period evolving from 1.43 seconds in 2003 to 1.13 seconds in 2014. It has an isotropic peak luminosity of ~1000 times the Eddington limit for a NS at 17.1 megaparsec. Standard accretion models fail to explain its luminosity, even assuming beamed emission, but a strong multipolar magnetic field can describe its properties. These findings suggest that other extreme ULXs (x-ray luminosity ≥ 1041 erg second−1) might harbor NSs.}

title = {The Carnegie–Chicago Hubble Program. IX. Calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch Method in the Megamaser Host Galaxy, NGC 4258 (M106)},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {In the nearby galaxy NGC 4258, the well-modeled orbital motion of H2O masers about its supermassive black hole provides the means to measure a precise geometric distance. As a result, NGC 4258 is one of a few “geometric anchors” available to calibrate the true luminosities of stellar distance indicators such as the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) or the Cepheid Leavitt law. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the apparent magnitude of the TRGB within NGC 4258, using publicly available HST observations optimally situated in the unreddened stellar halo along the minor axis, spanning distances ranging from 8 to 22 kpc in projected galactocentric radius, or  (13 kpc) to  (66 kpc) in distance along the semimajor axis. We undertake a systematic evaluation of the uncertainties associated with measuring the TRGB in this galaxy, based on an analysis of 54 arcmin2 of HST/ACS imaging. After quantifying these uncertainties, we measure the TRGB in NGC 4258 to be F814W0 = 25.347 ± 0.014 (stat) ± 0.042 (sys) mag. Combined with a recent 1.5% megamaser distance to NGC 4258, we determine the absolute luminosity of the TRGB to be  (stat)  ± 0.048 (sys) mag. This new calibration agrees to better than 1% with an independent calibration presented in Freedman et al. that was based on detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) located in the LMC.}

volume={373},

abstract={MANY galaxies are thought to contain massive black holes— exceeding ten million solar masses—at their centres1,2, but firm observational evidence has proved to be surprisingly elusive. The best evidence comes from observing gas or stars rotating rapidly within a small region around a central body. If the observed velocities are due solely to the gravitational force of the central body—as in the Solar System-then the mass of the central body can be readily calculated. Here we present observations of rotating gas near the centre of the galaxy NGC4258 (Ml06), which indicate the presence of a mass of 3.6 x 1077solar masses in a region less than 0.13 pc in radius. The volume-averaged mass density in this region exceeds by a factor of at least 40 that for any other black-hole candidate observed previously. These observations provide compelling evidence that a massive black hole exists at the centre of NGC4258.},

journal={Nature Astronomy},
pages={976--983},
volume={6},
number={8},
abstract={H2O MegaMaser emission may arise from thin gas discs surrounding the massive nuclei of galaxies such as NGC 4258, but the physical conditions responsible for the amplified emission are unclear. A detailed view of these regions is possible using the very high angular resolution afforded by space very long baseline interferometry (SVLBI). Here we report SVLBI experiments conducted using the orbiting RadioAstron Observatory that have resulted in detections of the H2O 22 GHz emission in NGC 4258, with Earth–space baselines of 1.3, 9.5 and 19.5 Earth diameters. Observations at the highest angular resolutions of 11 and 23 μas show distinct and regularly spaced regions within the rotating disc, at an orbital radius of about 0.126 pc. These observations at three subsequent epochs also indicate a time evolution of the emission features, with a sudden rise in amplitude followed by a slow decay. The formation of these emission regions, their regular spacing and their time-dependent behaviour appear consistent with the occurrence of a periodic magneto-rotational instability in the disc. This type of shear-driven instability within the differentially rotating disc has been suggested to be the mechanism governing the radial momentum transfer and viscosity within a mass-accreting disc. The connection of the H2O MegaMaser activity with the magneto-rotational instability activity would make it an indicator of the mass-accretion rate in the nuclear disc of the host galaxy.},
