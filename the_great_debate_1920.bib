 abstract = {No one now living attended the original lectures by Curtis and Shapley, and the scientific and other worlds in which they moved are connected to ours only by the written record and second-hand stories. Depending on which corners you choose to peer into, those worlds can seem remarkably modern or remarkably ancient. As is often the case for classic dichotomies, the wisdom of hindsight reveals that each of the speakers was right about some things and wrong about others, both in choosing which data to take most seriously and in drawing conclusions from those data. Modern (mostly casual) discussions of the 1920 event leave the impression that Shapley was, on the whole, the winner. But the two men's reactions to Hubble's discovery of Cepheids in the Andromeda galaxy make clear that both felt the issue of existence of external galaxies (on which Curtis had been more nearly correct) was of greater long-term importance than the size of the Milky Way (on which Shapley had been more nearly correct). Shapley is much the better known today and is generally credited in text books with the Copernican task of getting us out of the center of the galaxy. Under modern conditions, he would probably also have gotten most of the press notices. Curtis's repeated theme, "More data are needed," is remarkably difficult, then as now, to turn into a headline.},

 abstract = {On April 21, 1996, Sidney van den Bergh and Gustav Tammann engaged in a public debate titled "The Scale of the Universe." The arguments they presented focused on recently determined and still controversial values of the Hubble Constant. The program was moderated by John Bancali, with lectures on the background and history behind humanity's quest for the scale of the Universe given by Owen Gingerich and Virginia Trimble. These introductory lectures along with the arguments presented by the 1996 debaters are recreated in the following papers. This debate was of the same title and held in the same auditorium as the "Great Debate" between Heber Curtis and Harlow Shapley in 1920. Here we discuss some of the issues surrounding the organization and inspiration for the 1996 debate. Like the 1920 debate, the 1996 debate was not intended to resolve a disagreement instantly. Instead it is hoped that this debate and the written contributions will stand as educational tools, summarizing the arguments behind today's Hubble Constant controversy, and will help provide a framework for evaluating progress in this field as the century which saw its creation draws to a close. Together with last year's debate, "The Distance Scale to Gamma Ray Bursts" (Nemiroff, R. J. 1995, PASP, 107, 1131), these papers may also provide a clue as to how scientists think.},

 abstract = {Before the discovery of the expanding universe, one of the challenges faced in early relativistic cosmology was the determination of the finite and constant curvature radius of space-time by using astronomical observations. Great interest in this specific question was shown by de Sitter, Silberstein, and Lundmark. Their ideas and methods for measuring the cosmic curvature radius, at that time interpreted as equivalent to the size of the universe, contributed to the development of the empirical approach to relativistic cosmology. Their works are a noteworthy example of the efforts made by modern cosmologists toward the understanding of the universe as a whole, its properties, and its content.},

The first section describes the early Greek determinations of the distances of the Sun and Moon. The second part discusses the distances to the stars, from Copernicus to Huygens. Section 3 skips to the early twentieth-century ideas on the scale of the Milky Way, especially the work of Shapley. The final section describes how Hubble's discovery of distances to galaxies was first announced.},
